# Open Source at VNG Realisatie

VNG Realisatie is both a user and contributor to and developer of, [Open Source](https://opensource.org/faq#osd) projects.

The **Vereniging Nederlandse Gemeenten (VNG)** is, literally translated, the Association of Dutch Municipalities. **VNG Realisatie** is a branch that realises products like standards and shared software.

Our projects are focussed on standardisation of information exchange and use in and between local municipalities in The Netherlands.

We publish the source code to [our projects](projects/) on [GitHub.com/VNG-Relisatie](http://github.com/vng-realisatie). We publish the source code under Open Source licences that allows anyone to view the source and to copy our source code to use it in their projects. We do not provide any warranties or guarantees on the reuse of our source in othersâ€™ projects.

We are looking forward to collaborating with you!
